# Indian Climate Change Project üåè
A public project aimed at gathering and analyzing data to predict climate change trends in India.
This project focuses on collecting a variety of environmental, atmospheric, and geographical data to build predictive models for climate scenarios. The insights derived can be used to inform policies, promote sustainability, and mitigate the effects of climate change.

# Project Goals
- Collect comprehensive data on climate-related variables like temperature, rainfall, air quality, soil moisture, and more.
- Analyze historical and current data to identify trends and anomalies.
- Develop models to predict future climate conditions in India.
- Provide open-access data and tools to empower researchers, policymakers, and citizens.

# Key Features
- Data Collection: From meteorological stations, IoT devices, and satellite imagery.
- Analysis Tools: Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks for data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning.
- Open Data Access: Data will be structured and shared for public use.
- Predictive Models: AI/ML algorithms to predict climate scenarios.
