# Indian Climate Change Project üåè
A public project aimed at gathering and analyzing data to predict climate change trends in India.
This project focuses on collecting a variety of environmental, atmospheric, and geographical data to build predictive models for climate scenarios. The insights derived can be used to inform policies, promote sustainability, and mitigate the effects of climate change.

# Project Goals
- Collect comprehensive data on climate-related variables like temperature, rainfall, air quality, soil moisture, and more.
- Analyze historical and current data to identify trends and anomalies.
- Develop models to predict future climate conditions in India.
- Provide open-access data and tools to empower researchers, policymakers, and citizens.

# Key Features
- Data Collection: From meteorological stations, IoT devices, and satellite imagery.
- Analysis Tools: Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks for data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning.
- Open Data Access: Data will be structured and shared for public use.
- Predictive Models: AI/ML algorithms to predict climate scenarios.

# Climate Data Collection Parameters for India

## Core Atmospheric Parameters
1. **Temperature**
   - Surface temperature (minimum, maximum, and average daily temperatures)
   - Atmospheric temperature at various altitudes (if feasible)
2. **Humidity**
   - Relative humidity
   - Dew point temperature
3. **Pressure**
   - Atmospheric pressure (at sea level and local levels)
4. **Precipitation**
   - Rainfall (daily, monthly totals)
   - Intensity and duration of rainfall events
5. **Wind**
   - Speed and direction (at surface level and higher altitudes)
6. **Solar Radiation**
   - Solar irradiance (direct, diffuse, and total)

## Land Surface Parameters
1. **Soil Moisture**
   - Particularly important for monsoon and drought predictions.
2. **Land Use and Vegetation**
   - Cropping patterns, deforestation, and urbanization.
3. **Surface Albedo**
   - Reflectivity of land, especially in snow-covered or desert areas.

## Water and Oceanic Parameters
1. **Surface Water Levels**
   - Rivers, lakes, and reservoirs (monitoring for droughts and floods).
2. **Sea Surface Temperature (SST)**
   - For coastal regions, critical for cyclone predictions.
3. **Groundwater Levels**
   - Seasonal variations, especially in drought-prone areas.

## Greenhouse Gases and Air Quality
1. **Carbon Dioxide (CO2)**
   - Local sources if possible (industrial areas).
2. **Methane (CH4)**
   - From wetlands, agriculture, and livestock.
3. **Aerosols**
   - Dust, soot, and particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10).

## Seasonal and Cyclical Influencers
1. **Monsoon Patterns**
   - Onset, retreat, and variability.
2. **El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation (ENSO)**
   - Links to Indian monsoon.
3. **Extreme Events**
   - Historical data on cyclones, heatwaves, and floods.

## Key Sources in India
- **IMD (Indian Meteorological Department)**: Weather data, rainfall, temperature, and seasonal patterns.
- **ISRO Satellites**: Data on land use, vegetation, and oceanic conditions.
- **CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board)**: Air quality and aerosols.
- **ICAR (Indian Council of Agricultural Research)**: Soil and crop data.
- **IWMI (International Water Management Institute)**: Groundwater and water body monitoring.

## Prioritization for Limited Resources
1. **High-Impact Parameters**: Temperature, humidity, pressure, and rainfall (easiest to measure locally).
2. **Regional Data**: Focus on state-level or local conditions if national data isn't detailed.
3. **Collaboration**: Partner with research institutions like IITs, IISc, or local universities for access to specialized datasets.
